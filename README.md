# ZoopFit
The R package *ZoopFit* is the companion package for the paper Castillo-Mateo et al. (2023) <doi:update-when-available>. The package includes functions to fit and predict with the double data fusion and calibration models from the paper. 

**Warning:** Please note that the code provided is for the paper only and a generalization is under development. I do not guarantee that it will work outside of the data from the paper and it will likely lead to errors if used with other datasets.

## Installation
